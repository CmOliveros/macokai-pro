# Macokai Pro

A shameless fork of Subtheme's Monokai Pro theme, modified to match colors with macOS. I thoroughly welcome somebody who knows anything about Jetbrains themes/Java to improve this.  
  
This repo is a mess. Feel free to fix it at my [GitHub](https://github.com/CmOliveros/macokai-pro).
